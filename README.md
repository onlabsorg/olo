**`olowiki`** is a platform for creating web content in a cooperative way.
It is a simple, distraction-free and unobtrusive wiki aiming to provide you 
with nothing more than read-write web.
  
You can see it in action [here](https://wiki.onlabs.org).
  
For now the only developers documentation available is the source code itself,
but if you are interested in contributing, you can contact me:
