  ### In the beginning it was the world-wide web

  The web started as a world-wide distributed archive of documents, linked

  together with hyperlinks. From wikipedia:


  > The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space
  where 

  > documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource
  Locators (URLs), 

  > interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet.


  Browser are software that allow users to load and visualize web documents.  


  Creating and publishing a document was not as straighforward as reading an

  existing document from the internet. Therefore, for most of its users, the
  web 

  was a read-only store of documents.




  ### Then javascript came in to play

  Once web browsers implemented a scripting engine able to run code contained

  in web documents, the web pages started to become interactive up to turn into

  actual application (so called *web applications*).  


  Besides turning documents into programs, web application changed the read-only

  web into a read-write web. Users can often contribute content to the
  application.  


  Some web applications even allow users to input documents and organize your

  documents in a store internal to the application: the document, turned into an

  application, is now turned again into a document!




  ### Back to just documents

  Why don't we keep it simple? Why the original web document can't be a
  read-write

  document? This is what olo is trying to achieve.  

  Nothing agains web application, just trying to keep simple things simple.



  ### Definition of semantic web from Wikipedia

  > The Semantic Web is an extension of the World Wide Web through standards by 

  > the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The standards promote common data
  formats 

  > and exchange protocols on the Web, most fundamentally the Resource
  Description 

  > Framework (RDF). According to the W3C, "The Semantic Web provides a common 

  > framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, 

  > enterprise, and community boundaries". The Semantic Web is therefore
  regarded 

  > as an integrator across different content, information applications and
  systems.


  ### Berner-Lee vision of semantic web

  > I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing 

  > all the data on the Web â€“ the content, links, and transactions between
  people 

  > and computers. A "Semantic Web", which makes this possible, has yet to
  emerge, 

  > but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our
  daily 

  > lives will be handled by machines talking to machines. The "intelligent
  agents" 

  > people have touted for ages will finally materialize.




  The simplest way to look at it is as a publishing tool: you can create a web
  document

  and publish it with a click.


  The web


  The web started as a tool for sharing your documents with others.

  Web documents could refer to each-other through hyperlinks.

  A software called browser allows you to read web documents.

  Publishing web documents requires other tools and it is still not
  straightforward.


  With time those documents became more and more complex, 


  Olo adds a thin layer to that simple and powerful idea:

  * It makes very easy to create and publish a document

  * It allows you to, not only link your document to other documents, but also
  to use their content in your document.
