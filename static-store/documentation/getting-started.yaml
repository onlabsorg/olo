    **`olowiki`** is a platform for creating web content in a cooperative way.
    It is a simple, distraction-free and unobtrusive wiki aiming to provide you 
    with nothing more than read-write web.

    ### Edit this document

    The page you are reading now is an olowiki document. If you click on the
    edit button (top-right icon) or if you hit `ctrl-e` on your keyboard, you 
    enter in edit mode and you can change the document content.  

    To do so, you need to know the wiki language of the olowiki documents.
    You can dig later in the [olowiki format documentation](./file-format); 
    for now, just modify the big chunk of markdown text you see under the 
    `index:` key.

    When you are done changing the document source, you can go back to view
    mode by clicking the done button (top-right check mark in edit mode) or
    hitting again `ctrl-e` on your keyboard.

    If then you try to save the document by clicking on the save button or by
    hitting `ctrl-s` on your keyboard, you will get a permission denied error.
    That's because only the author is allowed update its documents.


    ### Create your own document
      
    How do you create your own documents then? 
    * First identify yourself by signing-in (top-left icon, next to the document title)
    * Then type the url of the document you want to create in the address bar, 
    e.g. `wiki.onlabs.org/docs/sandbox/your-document-name`. 
    If a document with that URL doesn't exist yet, then you can create it by 
    editing and saving it. 

    Feel free to play around, but please, when you do so, be so kind to use the 
    `/docs/sandbox` namespace.


    ### Use others documents content in your document

    In your document you can import other documents, both yours or from other
    authors. You can use all the data contained in the imported document, like
    numerical value, text, expressions, templates, etc.  
      
    This means that olowiki allows modularity in documents composition.


    ### Share your dcuments with other people

    Nobody can read your document unless you allow them to. To do so you need
    to make your document public. Once your document is public, everybody
    can read it and import it in their documents.  

    You are now able to read this document because I made it public.  

    To make a document public, you need to set the `public:` key to `true`.


    ### Next learning step

    Now that you know what olowiki is about, you should learn the
    [olowiki language](./file-format) to write your documents.  
      
    Happy learning :-)
